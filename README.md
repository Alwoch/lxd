# LXD
LXD is a next generation system container and virtual machine manager.
It offers a unified user experience around full Linux systems running inside containers or virtual machines.

It's image based with pre-made images available for a [wide number of Linux distributions](https://images.lxd.canonical.com)
and is built around a very powerful, yet pretty simple, REST API.

<!-- Include start installing -->

## Installing LXD from packages
The LXD daemon only works on Linux but the client tool (`lxc`) is available on most platforms.

OS                  | Format                                            | Command
---                 | ---                                               | ---
Linux               | [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/lxd)                  | snap install lxd
Windows             | [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/lxc) | choco install lxc
MacOS               | [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/lxc)  | brew install lxc

For more instructions on installing LXD for a wide variety of Linux distributions and operating systems, and to install LXD from source, see [How to install LXD](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/stable-4.0/installing/) in the documentation.

## Security

<!-- Include start security -->

Consider the following aspects to ensure that your LXD installation is secure:

- Keep your operating system up-to-date and install all available security patches.
- Use only supported LXD versions (LTS releases or monthly feature releases).
- Restrict access to the LXD daemon and the remote API.
- Do not use privileged containers unless required. If you use privileged containers, put appropriate security measures in place. See the [LXC security page](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/security/) for more information.
- Configure your network interfaces to be secure.
<!-- Include end security -->

See [Security](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/stable-4.0/security/) for detailed information.

**IMPORTANT:**
<!-- Include start security note -->
Local access to LXD through the UNIX socket always grants full access to LXD.
This includes the ability to attach file system paths or devices to any instance as well as tweak the security features on any instance.

Therefore, you should only give such access to users who you'd trust with root access to your system.
